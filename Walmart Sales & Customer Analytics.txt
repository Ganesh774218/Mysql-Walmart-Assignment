Walmart Sales & Customer Analytics Using MySQL
Project Report

Introduction
Retail businesses generate vast amounts of transactional data that can be analyzed to improve sales strategies, inventory management, and customer experience. This project focuses on building a MySQL-based database system for Walmart, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and analytical queries.
The Walmart SQL assignment includes various aspects of retail analytics, such as: ‚úî Tracking product sales to determine the highest-selling categories.
‚úî Analyzing payment methods to identify customer preferences.
‚úî Studying customer behavior based on demographics, purchase frequency, and ratings.
‚úî Evaluating branch and city-wise sales performance to optimize inventory distribution.
‚úî Applying SQL functions such as aggregations, joins, ranking functions, and data filtering for meaningful insights.
This project leverages SQL queries to answer key business questions, allowing Walmart to make data-driven decisions and enhance its competitive advantage in the retail industry.

Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
‚úî Develop a structured database for Walmart‚Äôs sales transactions.
‚úî Analyze revenue trends across different product lines and payment methods.
‚úî Track customer behavior by studying purchase frequency, ratings, and spending habits.
‚úî Identify top-performing products and cities with the highest revenue.
‚úî Enhance business forecasting using SQL techniques.
‚úî Optimize database queries for efficient retrieval and performance

The primary goal of this MySQL-based Walmart database system is to enable efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis to support business decision-making and retail performance optimization. The project aims to:
- Develop a structured database that accurately stores Walmart‚Äôs transactional data, including customer demographics, product sales, payment methods, and revenue metrics.
- Implement advanced SQL queries to extract actionable insights on customer preferences, product performance, and financial trends.
- Analyze sales and revenue trends by tracking transactions across multiple branches, cities, and product categories.
- Evaluate payment methods to determine the most commonly used options and improve financial processing efficiency.
- Identify high-performing products based on sales volume and revenue contribution to optimize inventory management.
- Assess customer ratings to understand service satisfaction levels and enhance overall customer experience.
- Improve business forecasting by leveraging SQL techniques such as aggregations, filtering, and ranking functions.

Methodology
The project follows a structured data-driven methodology involving the following steps:
- Database Design & Schema Creation
- Define a relational database structure using MySQL to store Walmart transactional data.
- Create tables including transactions, customers, products, sales, and payment_methods.

- Gather historical retail data including product lines, sales revenue, customer demographics, and payment transactions.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
- SQL Query Implementation
- Apply SQL aggregations to compute total sales, revenue trends, and average ratings.
- Utilize JOINs and subqueries to correlate multiple tables for deeper insights.
- Implement ranking functions to determine top-selling product lines, highest revenue cities, and customer purchase behaviors.
- Data Analysis & Interpretation
- Execute complex queries to examine purchasing patterns, customer preferences, and seasonal sales variations.
- Analyze distinct city count, payment method frequency, and revenue breakdown using SQL functions.
- Performance Optimization
- Utilize indexing and query optimization to ensure fast and efficient database operations.
- Implement stored procedures for repeated analytical queries.
- Result Interpretation & Business Recommendations
- Summarize key findings and provide business insights to help Walmart improve sales, customer experience, and inventory management.
- Propose future enhancements including predictive analytics, real-time tracking, and automation using Python & SQL.
